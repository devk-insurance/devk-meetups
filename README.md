## DEVK Meetups Documents and Presentation

We at [DEVK](https://www.devk.de) are working actively in technologies and methods to bring our apps to the next level. 
@DEVK Meetups, Cologne we try to find topics, in which we are interesting in and look at two alternatives which we can compare of. Examples of some interesting topics are:

- UI Frameworks: GWT vs. VueJS
- Microservice vs. Monolith
- Microservice Orchestration vs. Microservice Choreography
- Rancher vs. OpenShift
- Scrum vs. V-Model
- Spring Boot vs. Quarkus
- Native Development vs. Non-Native Development

In this repository you will find all presentations @DEVK Meetups, Cologne.

Enjoy,
Jörg and Lofi
